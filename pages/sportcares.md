#### At SportCares, we are set apart by sport.
We leverage positive sports experiences to make a difference for the at-risk and underserved in our community. Simply because great sports programming opens doors.

> Sport engages the mind, body and soul in meaningful ways – it builds self-belief.
 Sport demands that they become leaders – it equips them with integrity.
 Sport reminds them that they are team players – it gives them a sense of belonging.

A little more sports in the lives of the underprivileged and underserved can empower them to become greater than they ever imagined.

And greater people make a greater nation.
